<p>It is another special day again the world stands still with joy and heartfelt gratitude to celebrate the extraordinary person who has been a constant source of inspiration, strength, and love in our lives. Ede Ezinne Stella, our beloved sister, it's your birthday, and the world deserves to know just how exceptional you are.

As the first daughter of our family, you have worn the mantle of responsibility with grace and unwavering commitment since our childhood days. From helping with homework those days of Group School to offering sage advice, your wisdom and caring nature have been the guiding light for all of us. You've shown us the way, and we've followed gladly because your path has been one paved with kindness, resilience, and unwavering support.</p>
			    
<p>Ada, you have taken on so many responsibilities. You have helped our parents raise us, and you have always been there to support us in our endeavors. <a style=" color: gold;"><b>You are the glue that holds our family together.</a></b>

I am so grateful for all the contributions you have made in my life and that of our other siblings. You have taught us so much about life, love, and family. You have shown us what it means to be kind, compassionate, and hardworking.

Your contributions to our lives are immeasurable. You've been there through thick and thin, offering a shoulder to lean on, a listening ear, and a heart full of love. You've celebrated our successes and lifted us up during challenging times. Your strength despite your weaknesses and constant wars knows no bounds. 
<b>Your show of strength especially during the death and burial of our Dad showed you are indeed a super woman. I am so proud of you</b>💪🏽

You've been my confidante, my partner-in-crime, and my source of strength. Through all the trials and tribulations, you've been the constant pillar of support, reminding me that I am never alone in this journey called life. Your belief in me has fueled my determination, and your love has fortified my spirit.</p>

<p>Today, as we celebrate you, let the world know that you are not just a sister, but a beacon of hope, a reservoir of wisdom, and a fountain of love. Your generosity knows no limits, your kindness touches hearts, and your laughter lights up the room.

 <i>A very good example is the last time we gathered at home just about 2 weeks ago. Your presence, engaging discussions and laughter made the stay worthwhile. I must confess it is the reason I stayed back that long despite the obvious power issue. I seriously wished it never ends</i> 🤦🏼‍♂️
 <b>Those days or reunion remains one of the most beautiful moments of my life</b>🥰.

May this special day bring you boundless joy, laughter, and cherished moments. May your path continue to be filled with success and happiness. May you find fulfillment in every endeavor, and may your heart be forever aglow with the warmth of love and the beauty of life.

Ede Ezinne Stella, you are not just a year older today; you are a year wiser, a year stronger, and a year more beautiful in every way. As you blow out the candles and make your birthday wishes, know that our greatest wish is for your life to be filled with endless blessings and happiness.

Happy Birthday, dear sister! Your presence in our lives is a gift beyond measure, and today, we celebrate you with overflowing love and appreciation. Here's to you, the remarkable Ede Ezinne Stella – our sister, our friend, and our eternal source of inspiration. May your days be filled with love, laughter, and boundless joy.

With all our love and warmest wishes,
Ede Ifeanyi Barth
I love you 💝</p>

<p>Today is a special day to me and my household because on this day, years ago, God blessed us with a golden child who grew up to be a blessing to all of us.
Sister Ede, you have brought so much love and light to our lives and your kindness is way out of this world and I pray that the love you give to others return to you in more ways. 
	And coming to my life, you have been more than a just a sister to me, you have been my mother, my friend and my 'always run to' person. You have nurtured and molded me to the woman I am today.</p>
	<p>Most times, I wonder what my life would have been like if I don't have you in it. I bet it will be like that of a regular girl filled with so much mistakes and regrets but you always make sure I don't make those mistakes you've made and that of the ones my mates are making. I'm grateful for the gift of you, for how you love me despite my stubbornness, how you care for me like am your child, how you look out for me, how you want me to succeed, how you want me grow into a better woman, I'm thankful to you for your advice and guidance, for making me a financial woman, you made me take my finances serious, for the past 2yrs,it's been better. I can't count everything even if I want to but I'm sure you know how grateful I am to be blessed with you. I love you and I pray you keep getting better in all angles of your life, you take so much time to care and worry for others, I want you to take as much time to care for you too.
This new year will be the best you've had, you'll be better at your finances and health wise, your days of lack are gone, God will continue to bless and guild you all the days of your life. Amen! 
	 Happy birthday sis😘💞

<p>Dear Zinny,

On this special day that marks another beautiful chapter in your life, I want to extend my warmest and most heartfelt birthday wishes to you. You are not just my found sister; you are my confidant, my partner in mischief, and my forever friend. Your presence in my life has been a gift beyond measure, and my love for you knows no bounds.

From the moment we met, you opened your arms and your heart to me, embracing me as a part of your life. That act of kindness and acceptance left an indelible mark on my heart. You are not only a sister but also a beacon of kindness, warmth, and unwavering love.</p>

<p>As you celebrate another year of your extraordinary journey, may this day be filled with laughter, joy, and the company of those who cherish you just as much as I do. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I'm grateful to be a witness to your incredible life.

Happy Birthday, dear sister! May this year bring you endless opportunities, boundless love, and a world of dreams realized. Know that I will always be by your side, cheering you on every step of the way.

With all my love,
Maryann Chinenye </p>
